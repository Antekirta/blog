        About me
    </div>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my blog! :)</p>
    <p>My name is Annie. A few words about me.
    </p>
    <p>Being curious by nature, I always enjoyed making trips to new places, discovering new horizons and learning how other people live.
        My life-long interest is nature of our world in all its aspects and guises. National Geographic and Around the World magazines 
        were my monthly must-reads at university. When I started travelling by myself, it was like I dived into a whole new world. 
        There were so many stories I brought back with me and wanted to share.
    </p>
    <p>The first time a thought about a blog struck me in 2016 when I was staying at a house of my Korean host who had found me by Couchsurfing.
        Then I found out how many stereotypes about nations and countries reside in our heads. Somehow at some moment I began to feel 
        as a representative who was responsible for the view of my country building up in people's minds during our encounters.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, that trip inspired me to research cultures, traditions, way of life, mentality of people I meet deeper and tell about it
        to the world. I really want people to be more conscious and respectful towards those keeping other customs. Understanding 
        diminishes fear and plants seeds of amiability. To me, being broaded-minded means to be wiser. 
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, my mission is to break stereotypes and to show beauty of the world in diversity. Enjoy! 
    </p>
