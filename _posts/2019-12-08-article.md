Are you looking for easy ways to reduce your environmental impact? Well, I have a crafted a mega-post full of easy swaps that we can make to reduce the impact we have on the planet. 

Some of these tips you might have already mastered, but hopefully you'll pick up a few new ones along the way too. 

## * Reduce Food Waste:
![Food](assets/img/foodwaste.jpg)
1. Write down what is inside of your fridge before you go grocery shopping! Plan meals around the food that needs to be eaten first. 
2. Buy less than you think that you need. We tend to over buy on food so remove on meal from your meal plan because you'll most likely have an unexpected dinner out or leftovers! 
3. Chop and store the produce when you get home from the store so creating meals is easy during the week. 
4. Store your food properly so it doesn't go bad! 
5. Ignore the dates. Best-by, sell-by, and use-by are NOT expiration dates. There's no scientific way to predict the exact day something is going to expire so use your best judgement with smell and taste. If it tastes fine - it's probably fine to eat. 
6. Eat your ends and stems. Are you still throwing the tops of the carrots and beets out? STOP IT. They are delicious!! Beet tops make a great chard substitute and carrot tops make a delicious pesto.
7. Save the peels of your onions, carrots, garlic, and celery ends to make a delicious vegetable stock that you can use to infuse more flavor into rice, quinoa, etc. 
8. Use your freezer to freeze fruits and veggies you might not have time to get to before they turn. 
9. Use slightly mushy fruits in smoothies or breakfast breads. 
10. If you do have any leftover food, make sure you compost it! Get our [guide for composting](https://pelacase.com/blogs/news/international-compost-awareness-week).

6. Take one less intercontinental or international flight this year and opt to vacation somewhere closer to home. 
7. Pack lighter when you travel.

9. Pitch working from home for a day or two to reduce emissions... and work in your pajamas. ; )
